# PRODIGY_CS_03
# 🔐 Password Strength Checker

A simple and interactive Python tool to assess the strength of a password based on best practices — including length, use of uppercase/lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

## 💡 How It Works

The tool checks your password against 5 key criteria:

- ✅ Minimum length of 8 characters
- ✅ At least one **uppercase** letter
- ✅ At least one **lowercase** letter
- ✅ At least one **digit**
- ✅ At least one **special character** (e.g., @, #, $, %, etc.)

Based on how many criteria are satisfied, it assigns a **strength level**:  
**Weak**, **Moderate**, or **Strong**, along with helpful feedback for improvement.
